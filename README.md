Linux Kernel Hot Patcher (2002)
“Linux Kernel Hot-Patcher” provides a mechanism to hot patch a Linux kernel on i386 based machines.Hotpatching is a process of making changes to the kernel of the operating system, and activate these changes without rebooting the system. Functions that are patched can be made active or inactive atomically as required by the user. These dynamically applied patches using the tool re-vector crucial kernel code to the patched code without interrupting the operation of applications. This greatly reduces the downtime to diagnose, test, analyze, and correct operating system kernel related problems.

The primary audience for this facility will be kernel development and sustenance engineers.

This was my MS - Software Engineering dissertation project back in 2002.
